logistic-tanks=Logistic tanks

[mod-description]
logistic-tanks=Use logistic robots to transport fluids directly from tank to tank without any need for barreling.

[entity-description]
logistic-storage-tank-active-provider=Sends its content to the logistic network.
logistic-storage-tank-passive-provider=Makes its content available to the logistic network.
logistic-storage-tank-storage=Long-term storage for the logistic network.
logistic-storage-tank-buffer=Requests specified items to be available for personal logistics and automated construction.
logistic-storage-tank-requester=Requests the specified fluid from the logistic network.
logistic-minibuffer-active-provider=Sends its content to the logistic network.

[technology-name]
logistic-fluids=Logistic fluid handling
logistic-minibuffer=Logistic minibuffer

[technology-description]
logistic-fluids=Unlocks logistic tanks which further expands the capabilities of the logistic robots. Requester tanks request fluids from the logistic network. Passive provider tanks provide fluids to the logistic network. Logistic robots will transport fluids between the two types of tanks but cannot deliver fluids to the character.
logistic-minibuffer=Logistic versions of minibuffers.

logistic-tanks-fluid-per-item=Liquid per cargo slot
logistic-tanks-robots-require-barrel=Craft logistic robots with barrels
logistic-tanks-enable-active-provider=Enable active provider tanks
logistic-tanks-updates-per-tick=Logistic tank updates per tick

[mod-setting-description]
logistic-tanks-fluid-per-item=How much liquid should a logistic robot be able to carry per cargo slot it has.
logistic-tanks-robots-require-barrel=Logistic robots require a barrel to craft in addition to their other ingredients.
logistic-tanks-enable-active-provider=Whether active provider tanks are enabled. When enabled, fluids from logistic tanks may get pushed into logistic chests.
logistic-tanks-updates-per-tick=How many logistic tanks will be updated per tick. If the logistic tanks are not sufficiently responsive, increase this number.
